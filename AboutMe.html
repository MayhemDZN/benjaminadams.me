  <h4>
  About Me
  </h4>
  <p> I'm Benjamin. I am in my 5th year at high school right now and studying English, Maths, Computer Science, Physics and Chemistry. I'm a Prefect, House Representative, MVP (Mentor in Violence Prevention) and run a programming club which teaches younger kids how to code and creates a place for my friends and I to work on our own projects during school time. </p>
